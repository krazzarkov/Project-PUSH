# Project-PUSH

A rigidbody based character controller. The idea was to create a controller which allows the player to get to very high speeds and retain them.

The movement system is based off of a combination of CSGO, Titanfall, and Tribes movement. 

The controller currently features the following movement features:

**Tribes Style "Skiing"**

The character physics are modelled after Source engine style air strafing allowing players to gain speed by moving sideways while in the air.

Everything is still a work in progress. My plans for this project are to turn this into a full game with a multiplayer deathmatch mode and a singleplayer speed run mode.
